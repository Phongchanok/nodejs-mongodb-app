/**
 * User schema for the credit wallet application.
 *
 * Each user has a unique username and a hashed password. A role field
 * controls access within the application â€“ the value can be one of
 * "user", "merchant", or "admin". Users and merchants both have a
 * credit balance stored directly on the user document. Admin users
 * typically do not use a personal credit balance but the field is
 * provided for completeness and to simplify queries. Using Mongoose
 * ensures that the collection enforces the structure defined here.
